This is the plugins.xml repository for the plugin manager for Notepad++

It is managed by davegb3, pull requests should be sent to him.

Documentation is at http://www.brotherstone.co.uk/npp/pm

files.sql holds the md5sums of the valid plugin files, this needs to be kept 
up to date too.

Branch: next
This is the branch that is used for collecting the next round of updates

Branch: live
This is in-sync with what is in production.  The next branch is merged into this
branch when it is ready to be pushed up to live.

Note that the real live file is a linearized version of the one held in the
repository - the repository copy should always remain the indented "pretty 
printed" version.

Cheers,

Dave + the Notepad++ team.
